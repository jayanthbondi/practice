                    <p>The 1992 Cricket World Cup was the fifth staging of the Cricket World Cup, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). It was held in Australia and New Zealand from 22 February to 
                        25 March 1992, and finished with Pakistan beating England in the final to become the World Cup champions for the first time.</p>
                    <p>Sachin Tendulkar says that the tournament provided him the opportunity to play against the best players of that era,
                        but is disappointed at not playing against his hero Viv Richards</p>
                    </br>
                    <p>“Just look at each team at that World Cup, there were some big names. England had Ian Botham, Graham Gooch, Allan Lamb. If you talk about South Africa, there was Kepler Wessels leading them and Peter Kirsten as a senior player. For Pakistan, there was Imran Khan, Javed Miandad and Wasim Akram. Having got a chance to play against them in Pakistan in 1989 itself was wonderful, but playing them in a world championship was a different feeling altogether,"
                         Tendulkar said.</p></br>

                         <p><strong>SACHIN'S SPECIAL INNINGS:</strong><br></p>
                         <p style="text-indent:10%;">It was the 15th match of the 1999 World Cup. India had lost their previous match against Zimbabwe following a close encounter and it seemed difficult for them to make it to the super 6s. India’s star batsman, Sachin Tendulkar had undergone a huge personal loss a week back, the loss of his father. 
                             He had been very vocal about his father’s support throughout his career and certainly everyone knew that this was a very very big loss
                            for the little master.</br>India  needed Tendulkar for this match, but his participation in the tournament wasn’t particularly clear. Call it passion,
                             dedication or responsibility to uphold the nation’s expectations from him, he returned three days after his father’s funeral to England to play against Kenya.</br>India batted first after losing the toss.He came second down at 92-2 with both the openers gone and Rahul Dravid on the other side. He started his innings carefully, carved it out slowly and after each landmark accelerated. It was a combined effort of aggression and defence. He reached his 50 in 54 balls  and 100 in 84. Ultimately he finished at 140 at just 105 balls
                              with 3 sixes and 16 fours guiding India to an excellent score of 329/2 with Dravid himself scoring a century-104 off 109 balls(which was completely ignored).<br>As soon as he reached his century, Tendulkar looked up in the skies, raised his bat in the air and had tears in his eyes. This innings was dedicated to his father. Call it his passion and dedication for the game or his mother’s

                    <p>The 2003 Cricket World Cup (known officially as ICC Cricket World Cup 2003) was the eighth Cricket World Cup, organized by the International Cricket
                         Council (ICC). It was co-hosted by South Africa, 
                        Zimbabwe and Kenya from 9 February to 23 March 2003. This edition of the World Cup was the first to be played in Africa.</br>
                        <p style="text-indent:10%;">Sachin Tendulkar produced a fairytale run in the 2003 World Cup, which, in his own words, incl
                            uded the biggest match of his career, without facing a single ball in the nets, according to former teammate Rahul Dravi
                            d, who says the iconic cricketer "defied imagination".
                                No cricketer ever has scored more runs than the 673 recorded then by the Indian legend in a single edition of a World Cup. The highlight was the 98-run knock that saw him take on the likes of Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar with aplomb.
                             "It (his preparation) changes from time to time. In the 2003 World Cup, Sachin Tendulkar didn't bat a single ball in
                              the nets, right through the tournament. He only got throw-downs. He just received hundreds of throw-downs through 
                              the whole tournament,".</p>

I want to feel good about my batting. If I have that sort of feeling, I will score runs when I go in.' And that's what happened!"

                            Calling the Mumbaikar the greatest player he has played with, Dravid said Tendulkar changed the landscape of Indian cricket.
                            
                            "He's changed the landscape, both on and off the field, for Indian cricket over the last two decades. It's almost mindboggling. A whole generation has grown up with Tendulkar. They've seen his ups and downs and lived their lives and dreams through 
                            his feats. So many people in India want to be a cricketer," Dravid said while speaking on ESPNcricinfo's

                    <p>The 2007 Cricket World Cup was the 9th edition of the Cricket World Cup tournament that took place in the West Indies from 13 March to 28 April 2007, using the sport's One Day Internat
                        format. There were a total of 51 matches played, three fewer than at the 2003 World Cup (despite a field larger by two 
                        teams)</p><br>
                        <p style="text-indent:10%">Sachin Tendulkar has rated the first-round exit in the 2007 World Cup as the worst moment of his professional career, and said the debacle was because the batting order "was not right".

                                India crashed out after defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the opening phase of the tournament, which took place at the end of Greg Chappell's tumultuous two years as coach.
                                
                                "I felt our batting order was not right," Tendulkar told the news channel Times Now. He has usually preferred to open the batting in one-dayers but was sent in at No. 4 in that World Cup. "It was a big tournament and we had a fantastic team. Everything 
                                looked well set but I felt our batting order was not right. This was one of the reasons (behind India's early ouster)."</p></br>
                                <p>He also spoke about his two stints as national captain, which are widely viewed as disappointing. "No regrets at all. Captaining is not about an individual but a team," he said. "Of course it was painful whenever the team lost but losing the 2007 World Cup was more disappointing."

                                        Tendulkar, who will complete 20 years in international cricket in four days' time, said he was targeting the 2011 World Cup title. "Touch wood, my body is holding 
                                        up nicely. Of course I'm looking forward to the 2011 World Cup and by God's grace we should be able to achieve what we

                    <p>The 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup was the tenth Cricket World Cup. It was played in India, Sri Lanka, and (for the first time) Bangladesh. India won the tournament, defeating Sr
                         wickets in the final at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, thus becoming the first country to win the Cricket World Cup final
                          on home soil.</p>
                          <p style="text-indent:10%"> Sachin Tendulkar has revealed that he started nurturing ambitions of winning the 2011 World Cup right after
                               India's crushing first-round exit in the 2007 edition of the tournament. Talking to Mid-Day after India's victory in the World Cup final, Tendulkar said the prospect of lifting the Cup in front of his home crowd had motivated him through tough times.

                                "That [winning the World Cup at the Wankhede Stadium] was my dream after
                                 we lost in 2007," Tendulkar said. "I took up that challenge. I said, the next World Cup is in Mumbai and this is where I would want the trophy. It was a challenge and I started working towards that.
                                
                                "After the 2007 World Cup when we got to know that the next one is in India and the final would be held in Mumbai. That is
                                 when I felt that this is the place where we have to lift the trophy."</p>
                                 <p style="text-indent:10%">Tendulkar said MS Dhoni's winning hit in the final was the most unforgettable moment of the campaign. 
                                     "The moment the winning runs were scored, I jumped," he said. "Viru [Virender Sehwag] who was next to me, jumped too. We were sitting in the dressing room and praying."

                                        India's win included hard-fought victories against each of the former World Cup champions. Tendulkar scored two centuries in losing causes, but rated his chancy 85 against Pakistan as his most important contribution. Tendulkar recalled a couple of critical moments in that game, which India went on to win and extend their unbeaten record against Pakistan in World Cups.
                                        
                                        "We set a 6-3 field against Pakistan at Mohali," Tendulkar said. "Their opening batsman, Mohammad Hafeez tried to play a 
                                        
                                        sweep shot off Munaf Patel and got caught behind. I thought that was the turning point of the match.
                                        
                                        "The catch Viru took off Shahid Afridi [was also crucial]. The match was very much alive then because Misbah-ul-Haq and 
                                        Afridi were batting and we needed two-three big overs at that stage, so that was an important catch. An easy one, but
                                         important."</p></br>
                                         <p>Sachin Tendulkar was the second highest run-scorer in ICC World Cup 2011. Tendulkar scored 482 runs from nine matches.</p>
